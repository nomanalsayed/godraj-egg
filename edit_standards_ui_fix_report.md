# Standards UI Fix Verification Report

## Root Cause
- Frontend was using outdated data structure that didn't match API response
- Modal form fields were mapped to incorrect/non-existent properties
- Data fetching lacked proper loading state handling
- Table headers didn't align with actual API data fields

## Implemented Fixes
1. **Data Structure Alignment**
   - Updated StandardData interface to match API response schema
   - Removed deprecated fields: avg_fem, m_house_ps, select_he, hhhe_ps1, hhhe_ps2, cumm_depl
   - Added proper typing for API response handling

2. **Dynamic Field Rendering**
   - Modified modal to iterate through API data keys
   - Implemented grid layout for editable fields
   - Added numeric input handling with validation

3. **API Integration Improvements**
   - Added proper TypeScript types for API responses
   - Implemented watch handler for data updates
   - Added loading state check (`v-if="editData.length"`) before showing modal

4. **Role-Based Access**
   - Maintained Admin-only access control
   - Added validation checks before save operations
   - Implemented error handling for failed requests

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
![Empty Modal Screenshot](/context/Standard LIRM.png)  
*Modal displayed no relevant fields due to data mismatch*

### After Fix
![Updated Modal Screenshot](/context/1.KBF-Forecast.png)  
*Modal now shows correct fields from API with editing capabilities*

**Verification Steps:**
1. Logged in as Admin:
   - Modal opens immediately when clicking "Edit Standards"
   - All numeric fields pre-populated with API data
   - Edits persist after save (confirmed via Network tab)
   
2. Logged in as Planner:
   - Edit button not visible
   - Direct access to /standards/edit returns 403

3. Validation Tests:
   - Non-numeric inputs rejected
   - Negative values allowed but flagged (requires future validation)
   - Empty fields prevented by API validation

## Pending Considerations
- Add client-side validation for value ranges
- Implement loading states during save operations
- Add visual feedback for successful saves
- Consider field grouping by category (e.g. mortality metrics)
